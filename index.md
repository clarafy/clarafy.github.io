I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in [Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences](https://eecs.berkeley.edu) at UC Berkeley, advised by [Jennifer Listgarten](http://www.jennifer.listgarten.com/) and [Michael I. Jordan](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/). I am a member of [BAIR](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) and am broadly interested in developing statistical learning and inference methods to engineer biological systems. Prior to Berkeley, I was a [Google Brain Resident](https://ai.google/research/join-us/ai-residency/), and spent a year conducting biologging fieldwork with [Kakani Katija](https://www.mbari.org/katija-kakani/) at the [Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Insitute](https://www.mbari.org/). I received my B.S. in [Computer Science](https://cs.stanford.edu/) in 2016 from Stanford University, where I was fortunate to work with [Marius Cătălin Iordan](http://www.princeton.edu/~miordan/), [Fei-Fei Li](http://vision.stanford.edu/feifeili/), and [Stephen Boyd](http://stanford.edu/~boyd). My work is generously supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

Beyond research, I am an avid consumer of science writing, religious fan of women's artistic gymnastics, and proud mom to an extraordinary son.
