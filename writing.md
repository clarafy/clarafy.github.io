When I consider the heart of why I do research, I always end up feeling much more like a biologist than a computer scientist. My awe is ultimately of life, in all its varied forms, not methodology. Though I suspect I would make a terrible experimental biologist in practice, I like to give a nod to the biologist within by writing about ecology and evolution research for the general public.
