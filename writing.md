When I consider the heart of why I do research, I always feel more like a biologist than a computer scientist. My motivating sense of wonder is ultimately of life; developing methodology enables that wonder. Though I suspect I would make a terrible experimental biologist in practice, I like to give a nod to the biologist within by writing about ecology and evolution research for the general public.
